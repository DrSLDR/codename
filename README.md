# Codename

Codename is a small utility program to randomly generate phrases, akin to
GfyCat URLs and Jitsi room names.

### Installation

It's not yet distributed via cargo -- it'll get there -- so in the meantime
you can clone and compile it with `cargo build`.

### License

Codename is licensed under the MIT license.

The wordlists and basic logic are adapted from Jitsi's
[js-utils](https://github.com/jitsi/js-utils) collection, specifically the
[roomNameGenerator](https://github.com/jitsi/js-utils/blob/master/random/roomNameGenerator.js).
